> **From Global Search to Local Lookup: Scalable Knowledge Base Completion via Differentiable Guarded Logic**  
> *Under review at vldb 2026*

This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation for **GUARDNET**. The code is designed to be a complete and faithful reproduction of the paper's methodology, enabling researchers to explore and build upon our work in scalable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

---

## 📋 Overview

**GUARDNET** is the first framework to leverage the **Guarded Fragment (GF)** of first-order logic as a principled inductive bias for robust and scalable neighborhood-based reasoning. It directly addresses the critical challenge of systematic generalization in deep learning, particularly in tasks requiring multi-hop inference, where existing models often fail.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Guarded Logic as Inductive Bias**: Employs the syntactic 'guard' of GF to restrict logical quantification to local, relational neighborhoods
- **Principled Fuzzy Semantics**: Built on differentiable fuzzy logic using **Product t-norms** and **Sigmoidal Reichenbach implication**
- **Hybrid Domain Training**: Novel training strategy combining **Core Domain** with **Latent Domain** for logical fidelity and robust generalization
- **Systematic Generalization**: Exceptional performance on challenging zero-shot, multi-hop reasoning tasks

## 🔧 Data Preparation

The framework expects standard knowledge base completion datasets, split into training, validation, and test sets. 

The datasets referenced in the paper include:

- SNOMED CT
- Gene Ontology (GO)
- Yeast PPI
- Human PPI

### 📁 Required Data Structure

Please place your datasets inside a `data/` directory, following this structure for each dataset:
```
data/your_dataset_name/
├── entities.txt      # List of all entity names, one per line
├── relations.txt     # List of all relation (predicate) names
├── train.txt         # Training facts (head_entity relation tail_entity)
├── valid.txt         # Validation facts
└── test.txt          # Test facts
```

The axioms (rules) for training should be provided in a separate file or defined within the data loading logic, following the syntax described in the paper.

## 🚀 Training & Evaluation

The code has been structured into separate files for clarity. The main entry point is `main.py`.

### 📊 Knowledge Base Completion (KBC)

This is the primary task for evaluating standard performance on concept subsumption and link prediction.

#### 1. Training

Use `main.py` to launch training. The script will load the configuration from `config.py`, initialize the `GuardNet` model, and run the training loop defined in `train.py`. 

The best model checkpoint is saved based on validation performance.
```bash
# Example: Training GUARDNET on a sample dataset
python main.py
```

<details>
<summary>🔧 Advanced Training Configuration</summary>

The `config.py` file centralizes all hyperparameters from the paper's appendix. You can modify it directly to tune the model.

Key parameters include:

- `embedding_dim`: Dimensionality of embeddings
- `learning_rate`: Initial learning rate for AdamW
- `batch_size`: Number of formulas per training batch
- `weight_decay`: L2 regularization coefficient for AdamW
- `lambda_start` & `lambda_end`: Curriculum parameters for the hybrid loss
- `lse_temperature`: The temperature τ for fuzzy quantifier approximation

</details>

#### 2. Evaluation

The evaluation logic is integrated into the training loop in `train.py`, which reports metrics after each epoch.

For standalone evaluation, you can load a saved checkpoint and run it on the test set:
```bash
python evaluate.py \
    --model_path checkpoints/best_model.pt \
    --data_path data/your_dataset_name
```

The evaluation follows the filtered ranking protocol described in the paper.
